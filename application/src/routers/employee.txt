Here is the analysis of the code from `employee.py`:

**Function 1: `read_employee`**

* **Prefix**: `/employee`
* **Function Name**: `read_employee`
* **Roles**: `employee`, `teamlead`
* **URL/Endpoint**: `/employees/reademployee`
* **HTTP Method**: `GET`
* **Path Parameters**: None
* **Class Parameters**: None

The `read_employee` function handles a GET request to retrieve employee details. It takes two dependencies: `db` (a database session) and `current_employee` (an authenticated employee object). The function first checks the employee's role and then retrieves the employee's details from the database. If the employee is not found, it raises an HTTPException with a 404 status code. Finally, it returns the employee's details in a dictionary.

Note: There are no path parameters, class parameters, or payload structures associated with this function.
